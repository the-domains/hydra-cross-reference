**We are the few, responding to the call of the many.**

**â€‹**

Spawned from the collective frustration of millions of contractors, distributors and manufacturers around the country looking to cross reference one manufacturer's part number to another's.

We are united and determined to deliver comprehensive and easy to access manufacturers' cross-references.

**Our aim is bold.**

To become the Google of Cross-Reference for the good of all of humanity.

First the electrical world, later who knows...
